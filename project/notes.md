### Suggestions

- [x] there should be system/controller on the top level that transfers information to other robots, e.g. which sides are of searched object are occupied. The robot receives the info and then it can compare it is true, let say tha mal. robot occipies other side that it reported, then the robots can verify it and report it.
- [x] create parsing controller that will parse the information from the robots, there will be defined knows keywords that robots store and it can modify their behaviour
- [x] save swhich robots are occupying which sides of the object
- [/] final destination for robot is not where is the final destination for object, I should adjust the final destination for robots
- [x] when transporting check the invironment, if new object is detected recreate the path
- [x] during transporting the robot are circulating sometimes, probably the steps are not reseted correctly
- [ ] trust
  - [x] swarm trust initialization
  - [x] Trust score erosion
    - [x] checkf in robot to robot communication
    - [x] check duration from last interaction -> in authority
  - [x] Trust decision
  - [x] Threshold Î¸mn
  - [x] Direct trust Td
  - [x] Indirect trust Ti
  - [x] Member deactivation
  - [x] Malicious member
    - [/] create a movement controller
    - [ ] create a communication controller
    - [/] create a detection controller
  - [x] refine calculateTrustLevel, in trust calculation there is not used previous trust score
  - [x] update authority trust level
  - [x] robot communication should happend only once on interserction
  - [x] more interaction events
  - [x] if robot doest not trust robot, also store the interactions and trust score
- [x] robots start in base
- [x] JSON config wiring
- [x] propagate consts from JSON config
- [x] UI
  - [x] layout
  - [/] colors
  - [x] grid map -> show mission info
  - [x] button for applying changes in config
- [x] after mission finished, stop timer
- [x] show malicious robot in different color, also reflect in left side menu
- [x] handle clearing all intervals
- [x] mal robot is increasing trust score when it is sending MOVE_TO_LOCATION but it should not => FIX: handle differently message types in makeTrustDecision function -> currently it is evaluated as true, but should be false,
- [x] replacing malicous robot in transporting if it was detected
- [x] malicious robot has for some reason some positive interactions, check it why -> the positive interactions are because of the average
- [x] when missing is in transporting phase it should not affect other robots that are searching, they should continue with searchind the environment and its state should not be affected by mission state change
- [x] when robot is excluded from swarm cancel all interactions with him
- [ ] create logger for every interaction
- [x] if replanned path, delete prev path from map
- [ ] test context data
- [x] improve athority trust level calculation -> currently when it comes negative interaction as first it is ignored by all and it can't be recovered -> it is ok because initialy robots doest not build trust so they dont trust each other so they are not responding to messages, if they would build some trust they would interact
- [x] improve context data
  - [x] total namber of robots
  - [x] detected malicous robots
  - [x] wasObjectFound
- [x] if innsufficient number of robot to tranport item, return them to base

- leaders messages should be automatically accepted or not?
