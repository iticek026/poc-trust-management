- [x] create parsing controller that will parse the information from the robots, there will be defined knows keywords that robots store and it can modify their behaviour
- [x] save swhich robots are occupying which sides of the object
- [/] final destination for robot is not where is the final destination for object, I should adjust the final destination for robots
- [x] when transporting check the invironment, if new object is detected recreate the path
- [x] during transporting the robot are circulating sometimes, probably the steps are not reseted correctly
- [ ] trust
  - [x] swarm trust initialization
  - [x] Trust score erosion
    - [x] checkf in robot to robot communication
    - [x] check duration from last interaction -> in authority

  - [x] Threshold Î¸mn
  - [x] Direct trust Td
  - [x] Indirect trust Ti
  - [x] Member deactivation
  - [ ] Malicious member
    - [ ] create a movement controller
    - [ ] create a communication controller
    - [ ] create a detection controller
  - [x] refine calculateTrustLevel, in trust calculation there is not used previous trust score
  - [x] update authority trust level
  - [ ] robot communication should happend only once on interserction
  - [ ] more interaction events
  - [x] if robot doest not trust robot, also store the interactions and trust score
- [x] robots start in base
- [x] JSON config wiring
- [x] propagate consts from JSON config
- [ ] UI
  - [x] layout
  - [/] colors
